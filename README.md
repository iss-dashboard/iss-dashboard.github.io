# ISS Dashboard
We track ISS telemetry data and display it in a fancy way. [Visit the site](https://iss-dashboard.github.io). You can check out the 3D position of the station in real time, see it's altitude evolve and monitor crucial system data.  

A lot of credit is owed to the ISS Mimic project. They were the main inspiration for this endeavor, and some parts of their code was reused. You can find their public Github repo [here](https://github.com/ISS-Mimic/Mimic) and their telemetry tracking site [here](https://iss-mimic.github.io/Mimic/).
